    "Description": "The ncurses (new curses) library is a free software emulation of 
                    curses in System V Release 4.0 (SVr4), and more. It uses terminfo 
                    format, supports pads and color and multiple highlights and forms 
                    characters and function-key mapping, and has all the other SVr4-curses 
                    enhancements over BSD curses. SVr4 curses became the basis of X/Open Curses."
